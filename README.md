### Introduction to OOP

#### **Definition of OOP**
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm centered around the concept of objects. Objects are instances of classes, which are blueprints for creating entities that encapsulate data (attributes) and behaviors (methods). OOP allows for the modeling of real-world entities in a structured and organized way.

#### **Four Pillars of OOP**
1. **Encapsulation**: 
   - **Definition**: Encapsulation is the process of bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, or class. It also restricts direct access to some of the object's components, which is a way of preventing accidental interference and misuse of the methods and data.
   - **Example**: Using private variables with public getter and setter methods.

2. **Inheritance**:
   - **Definition**: Inheritance is a mechanism where one class (child or subclass) acquires the properties and behaviors of another class (parent or superclass). It allows for code reuse and the creation of a hierarchical relationship between classes.
   - **Example**: A `Car` class inheriting from a `Vehicle` class.

3. **Polymorphism**:
   - **Definition**: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common super class. It typically occurs when a parent class reference is used to refer to a child class object.
   - **Example**: Method overriding where a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method already defined in its superclass.

4. **Abstraction**:
   - **Definition**: Abstraction involves hiding the complex implementation details of an object and exposing only the essential features to the user. It focuses on what an object does rather than how it does it.
   - **Example**: Using interfaces and abstract classes to define methods that must be implemented by derived classes.

#### **Benefits of OOP**
- **Modularity**: OOP allows developers to break down complex software into smaller, more manageable modules (classes). Each class can be developed, tested, and maintained independently.
- **Code Reusability**: Through inheritance, classes can be reused across different parts of a program or in different projects, reducing the need for redundant code.
- **Scalability and Maintainability**: OOP makes it easier to manage and scale large codebases by promoting a clean and organized structure.
- **Flexibility through Polymorphism**: Polymorphism allows for flexibility in code, enabling developers to introduce new classes with minimal changes to existing code.
- **Security**: Encapsulation helps protect an objectâ€™s state by controlling access to its data and methods, reducing the chances of unintended interference or misuse.
